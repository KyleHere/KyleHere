### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


* :star: I am currently working on and adding new features to [Gamernite](https://github.com/KyleHere/Gamernite), an event planner focused on Gaming tournaments, convention, or just your local get-togethers

* :wave: I'm always looking for new people to collaborate with on new exciting projects.

* :computer: Big fan of everything tech and tech-related, and would love to sit down and talk about that new invention.
